Hello, I'm Stephen Kaplan. I'm an open-source software developer focused 
on workflow automation, desktop applications, and web development. 
I actively maintain several projects, including several Python packages, 
a list of macOS automation resources, various Raycast extensions, and more. 
Some projects I've contributed to include rumps, a Python package for 
creating macOS menu-bar apps, and the Raycast Utils package for Node.js. 
I've also created and published a few node packages myself, and I'm 
currently working on a few more. In my spare time, I'm developing a few 
AppleScript libraries called ImageLib, PDFLib, and WebLib. I also have a 
YouTube channel (@helloimsteven3103) where I post videos showcasing my 
projects, and I'm hoping to expand it to include tutorials and other 
content in the future.
